# Iris Classification Streamlit App

This repository contains a simple Streamlit application that uses a RandomForestClassifier to predict the species of the Iris plant from user-defined sepal and petal measurements. Adjust the sliders to set the input values and view the prediction in real time.

## Features

- Load the Iris dataset and preprocess it with Pandas.
- Interactive input for sepal and petal dimensions using Streamlit sliders.
- Predict the Iris species using a pre-trained RandomForestClassifier.
- Display the prediction directly in the app.

## Installation

Make sure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed. Install the required dependencies with:

```bash
pip install streamlit pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

Running the App
Execute the following command in your terminal:
